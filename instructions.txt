#Snake game by Niklas Nurminen#283756

Snake moves with keyboard keys: W(UP), A(LEFT), S(DOWN), D(RIGHT)

Standart rules:
    -You can go through walls
    -If hit head hits snakepart = LOSE
    -If snake is as large as gameboard = WIN!

Game has three different difficulty levels:

Easy:   -Every second snake moves.
        -It doesn't speed up at anypoint.
        -Gameboard size is default 10x10.
        -Game has NO obstacles!

Medium: -Every 0.5 second snake moves.
        -Speed up everytime when snake eats food.
        -Gameboard size is 2x default.
        -Game has two obstacles, if hit game ends

Hard:   -Every 0.2 second snake moves.
        -Speed up everytime when snake eats food.
        -Gameboard size is 3x default.
        -Game has four obstacles, if hit game ends

If nothing above is pressed, default is going to be gamemode : EASY.

Other features:

Pause/Resume
    -Click button or hit spacebar

Quit
    -Click button or hit Esc

Restart
    -Restarts the game and you can choose gamemode again.

Things where I succeed:
    -Learned of the Qt mechanics from QGraphicsview to little parts like QGraphicsRectItem.
    -Pointers usage is getting more familiar
    -Basicly I learned to make QT objects move or vanish.
    -I enjoyed making this and also I studied a lot Qt library instructions
    -Overall snake movement code was very cleanly made and clearly.

Things I need to learn:
    -Whole code was done with only one class, because I realised idea too late.
    -QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsView was hard to use at the beginning
    -One additional feature is missing (make snake look more real snake) just because I don't have time.

Minimal requirements:
- The player must be able to start the game. //DONE
- The game must have a game area, where the snake moves. //DONE
- The player must be able to change the moving direction of the snake. //DONE
- The user must be able to distinguish between the food, the head of the snake, and the rest of the body of the snake. //DONE
- When the game ends, it informs about winning/losing and about the used time. //DONE
- Game rules are defined //DONE

Minimal requirements 5/5 DONE!

Additional features:
- The moving speed of the snake is not constantly the same, but the moving becomes faster when the game proceeds. //DONE
- The game has different levels of difficulty, and the user can choose between them. //DONE
- You can store the best result of the games played so far, and display it to the user. //DONE
- The snake does not consist of rectangles, but it looks more like a real snake. Note that in such case you need different corner pieces // NOT DONE
- The color of the snake varies piece by piece, for example,
    such that the shade of the head is the darkest one, and the shade becomes the lighter, the closer that part is to the tail. //DONE
- The snake does not crash to the border of the game area, but it continues its moving by the back way again to the game area. //DONE
- You can implement other more complicated rules in the game logic. // DONE
- Besides the food, there can be other objects to be eaten,
    and eating them has different effects e.g. on the size of the snake or on directing the snake. // NOT DONE
- Besides the borders, the game area contains other barriers. // DONE

Additional features 7/9 DONE!
